  	Season Rules

  </h4><p>
  	<ul><li> Teams will be expected to fill out a time sheet on<a href="https://doodle.com/"> https://doodle.com/ </a> to help expedite scheduling. If two teams that are playing have no corresponding times, favor will be given to the team that has more time slots selected as free times.
 You are expected to follow the Aggie Honor Code within games. Any reports of a team violating our Honor Code will be subject to penalty that could lower season rankings. </li>
<li> Teams must send at least one player, preferably the team captain, to Season Meetings. If special circumstances prevent this contact the season coordinator.</li>
<li> Teams must report all games to TAMULeague@yahoo.com Please wait until you have played all your games for the week before reporting. </li>
<li> Team should take screenshots of all games, but will only be required to send screenshots of their own victories. </li>
<li> If you forget to take a screenshot of the match in the post game you may give us information from LoLking.com, but all times from here will be considered to be in the 59th second of the minute it reports, because it does not report the seconds.
	 </li><br />
<ul>
	 Late Penalties
	 <li>
	 	A team is deemed late if they have not made any contact with the other captain.
	 </li>
	 <li>
	 	If a team is late to a match time by 15 minutes they take a caution, if it is a teams second time being cautioned they forfeit game one. (If game 2 is forfeited)
	 </li>
	 <li>If a team is late to a match time by 20 minutes (and have not already lost game one) they forfeit game one. </li>
<li>If a team is late to a match time by 30 minutes they forfeit game 2.</li>
<br />
<li>Only a Season Official may assign a late penalty to a team. Teams are to contact the Official if a penalty needs to be assigned.</li>

</ul>
  </p>
  <h4>Season Format</h4><p>
  	<ul><li> Teams will be initially ranked by their team representatives elo with some changes by the Season Coordinator based on previous years performances.</li>
<li>With the initial rankings teams will be broken up into “courts” of three teams apiece. If the number of teams is not a multiple of three one of two courts will contain only two teams.</li>
<li>Every monday teams will be given two times they are to play the other teams in their court. Initial times for these games will be placed using the information teams place into doodle.com</li>
<li>Rescheduling after initial times are sent is allowed and team captains will be given the info of other team captains to facilitate this. Once a different time is agreed upon both team captains must email the season coordinator in order to ensure consensus by both teams. After this the new time will be the teams official time to play.</li> 

<li>Games played in traditional 3 person courts are Bo2, while courts containing only 2 teams will be a Bo3. </li>
<li>Bo2 means you play 2 games regardless of outcome.</li>
<li>If teams do not have enough time, a Bo1 will not be punished, but the game will count as 2 for record. If both teams agree, before hand</li>
<li>At the end of the week the team in each court that has won the most games moves up in rankings, team that has won the least moves down in rankings, middle team will not move. </li>
<li>Ties, courts in which each team beats one team, will be broken by winner being the fastest win and loser being slowest win.</li>

<li>At the end of each 2 week period all teams should have played each other in a court. Reports must be into the season coordinator through http://amesports.org/ by the second Saturday at 11:59pm or the Coordinator has option to assign 2 losses to both teams.</li>
<li>At the end of each 2 week period win totals will be compiled and the person who has the most wins will move up one court and the person who has the least wins will move down one court.</li>
<li>In the event of a tie teams will need to play a tiebreaker game.</li>
<li>The tiebreaker will need to be completed by Sunday 11:59pm.</li>
